East-Central Europeâ€™s growth regime is heavily geared around FDI-organized exports. In this export economy, FDI-based industrial and advanced services loom large, with their structure articulated largely in line with the dependent market economy (DME) framework. To date, this growth regime has received much praise for bringing many of the ECE countries close to the higher income country group. The existing literature could benefit from more appreciation of the uneven development dynamics of this growth regime by taking seriously variation at the subnational level of analysis. This paper attempts to fill in these related gaps with the first quantitative and subnational evaluation of the contribution of domestic and foreign-owned economic sectors to economic development. By looking at the case of a typical FDI-led export regime (Romania), this paper uses locality-level data to address these gaps in ways that adequately deal with the drawbacks of spatial data aggregation. Furthermore, to account for the stability of the results, we employ different types of spatial methods, from spatial OLS to spatial moving windows used by a geographically weighted regression. The subnational political economy approach proposed herein stands to modify established insights of the rival literatures on varieties of capitalism and growth regimes.
